# ADAudit
Mail a formatted list of account audit events from a domain controller.

A simple PowerShell script to be run on schedule. Extracts events from the Security event log for account and group changes formatted as a simple table.  
It is very hacky.

The source includes an annotated list of EventIDs to be extracted.
